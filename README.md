# Alimentation-project
An alimentation project done in Java for the oriented programming course LU2IN002 at Sorbonne Universit√©
## What does the program do?
Our program simulates a sandwich shop (Subway being our inspiration), and it offers a menu with sandwiches and the option to compose your own sandwich. This program calculates the price of the sandwich, and some nutritional values like kcals and many others.
## How to run the program?
To run the program, we recommend to use eclipse for java developpers. If not, you can also use the following command:
```
javac *.java
```
Then,  a simple menu will appear, you just need to follow the instructions.
